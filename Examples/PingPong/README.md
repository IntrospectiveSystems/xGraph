### PingPong System

---
#### Description

This is the **PingPong** system. This system is an example of how modules
can work together in a system.

The **Ping** module sends a `"Ping"` command to the **Pong** module. Then,
Pong sends a *`Pong`* command to the Ping module. This shows how to connect
modules in a system and how modules can send commands back and forth.


To run each xGraph system, navigate to the system's directory (the
directory containg a config.json file) and type 

    xgraph run

in your terminal.
