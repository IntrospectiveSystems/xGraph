### Proxy v1.1.2

_Introspective Systems, LLC_

---
Proxy is a core module used to create TCP socket connections between two
modules in different systems. Proxy can operate as either a Server linked
to a specific Module within the same system, or as a Client connected to
another Proxy or other TCP connection. Then, modules can send commands
to the Proxy as if it were the destination module.

Proxy may also use the Plexus module to route message between modules instead 
of directly linking to other Proxy modules. In this case set Par.Chan on Proxy 
in a Proxy pair (Clients, Server). Proxy will need a local Plexus server running.
See the Examples in Examples/MultipleSystemsWithPlexus

---

#### Roles
Proxy's role must be assigned in it's module definition. The Proxy's
role is set in the `Role` parameter of it's module definition.

Proxy requires different parameters depending on what role it has been
assigned.

Role | Required Parameters | Optional Parameters
--- | --- | --- |
Client | Role, Link, Host, Port | Chan
Server | Role, Link, Port | Chan

Here is an example of two systems using the Proxy. The first uses Proxy
as a server module, setting the `Port` and the `Link` directly. The second
uses Proxy as a client module, setting the Host and the Port directly.
Set both Client and Server in the proxy pair to the same chan, and ensure they 
connect to a running Proxy module (Working example located in Examples/MultipleSystemsWithPlexus).

The `MultipleSystems\BankAccount` system structure object. Proxy is used
here as a server.
```
{
    "Sources": {
        "xGraph": "{xGraph}"
    },
    "Modules": {
        "Bank": {
            "Module": "xGraph.BankAccount"
        },
        "BankServer": {
            "Module": "xGraph.Proxy",
            "Par": {
                "Port": 27002,
                "Role": "Server",
                "Link": "$Bank"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `MultipleSystems\BankPatron` system structure object. Proxy is used
here as a client.
```
{
	"Sources": {
      "xGraph": "{xGraph}"
    },
    "Modules": {
        "BankPatron": {
			"Module": "xGraph.BankPatron",
			"Par":{
				"BankAccount":"$BankServer"
			}
        },
        "BankServer": {
            "Module": "xGraph.Proxy",
            "Par": {
				"Host": "127.0.0.1",
				"Port": 27002,
				"Role": "Client",
				"Poll": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```
#### Module Definition Parameters

**Role**: _String_ - Either 'Client' or 'Server'. Determines the
                        Proxy's operation mode.

**Host**: _String_ - The URL of the server the Proxy will connect to.

**Port**: _Integer_ - The port to open as a server, or the port
                        to connect to as a client.

**Link**: _String_ - Used when proxy is a Server. A reference to the
                        module that incoming commands received over the
                        TCP connection are routed to.
                        
**Poll**: _Boolean_ - Used to determine if Proxy should attempt to re-connect
												after failed connection attemps.
                        
**Chan**: _String_ - Used when managing connections using the Plexus module.
										 		Proxies with the same Chan (Channel) name will connect
										 		automatically when connected to the same Plexus server.

**Timeout** _Integer_ - The time in milliseconds to wait before poll attempts. 
													Used only if Poll is set to TRUE. 

**AutoSave** _Boolean_ - Should the Proxy be autoSaved into the cache.

**Encrypt** _Boolean_ - If false then we will not use encryption defaults to encrypt.

#### Input Commands

Proxy will route any dispatched command other than Start or Setup to
the socket connection.

#### Output Commands

Proxy will route any command received through the socket connection to
the module defined in Par.
