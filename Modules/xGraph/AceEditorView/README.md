#### AceEditorView

### Module Definition Parameters

Parameters are defined in the module definition and stored in the Par attribute
of the Entities this attribute.
Some are required, while some are optional. Below are the Parameters
that AceEditorView expects to be defined.

Two Pars can be set in the module definition, but they are all optional.

- `"Controller": "xGraphPid"`  - where xGraphPid should be replaced by the pid of the Module acting as this Modules controller.
- `"EvokeView": "xGraphModuleAddress"`  - where xGraphModuleAddress should be replaced by the address of the view that should be popped up when evoked.

An example of how this looks in the module definition of a config.json
``` json
{
  "AceEditorView": {
    "Module": "xGraph.AceEditorView",
    "Par": {
      "Controller": "$ControllerProxy",
      "AutoSave": true
    }
  }
}
```
