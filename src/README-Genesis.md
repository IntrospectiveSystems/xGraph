## Genesis.js

The Genesis.js script file is the kernel for an xGraph System. When initiated
through the xgraph command line tool (xgraph x, xgraph r, or xgraph c), the 
script will compile an xGraph System into a cache from a config file.

See xgraph -help for more explanation about the compiling and running options.

## Getting Started

Install xgraph through npm: `npm install -g xgraph` (sudo may be necessary on linux).

or 

Clone the xGraph Git repository for access to the Genesis.js source code. Once 
downloaded, `npm install -g .` will install the xgraph command line tool globally.
